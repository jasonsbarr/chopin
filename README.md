# Liszt Programming Language

Programming language that seeks to incorporate the best aspects of both functional and object oriented programming

This repo may end up being a prototype as I'm experimenting with bidirectional type checking.

Written with TypeScript v4.8.4.

## Basic Concepts

Liszt is a statically typed language with bidirectional type checking, which means most type annotations can be omitted. The only required type annotations are for function definition parameters.

Liszt is object-oriented with prototypes, but also has first-class functions and other functional programming features.

The syntax is inspired by Ruby and Python. The type system is inspired by TypeScript.

Liszt compiles to JavaScript, so it can be used both for browser-based applications and on the server via Node.js.
