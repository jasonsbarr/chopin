# Fawkes Prototype

Repo for trying out the concepts I will eventually write code for on camera for the Fawkes Programming Language

Written with TypeScript v4.8.4.

## Episodes

Note that when I actually film the series episodes may contain more or less content than what's listed here.

- Episode 01: setting up and compiling integers
- Episode 02: primitive types and object literals
- Episode 03: parsing type annotations and checking as expressions
- Episode 04: Lambdas, call expressions, and variables
